# GUW-CPT Helper

## Description
Helps create CPT's on the fly. Woop woop!


Whenever you need to create a custom post type in WordPress you can use this plugin to create and setup as many custom post types as you need for your site.

There will be a custom post type that is created whenever you install this plugin called "CPTS" and from here you will be able to add new custom post types. On each custom post type there will be a settings page that you will be able to adjust what is allowed in the custom post type.

In the future we would like to add in the ability to create a blog roll for the custom post types and then create a page that will display the custom post types. We would also like to add in the ability to create a shortcode for each custom post type and then select as an attribute in the shortcode for how many posts to display.
